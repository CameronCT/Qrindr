## PLEASE READ
I do not maintain Qrindr regularly as I have other duties, it is open source so any tournament organizer or developer can contribute to the project at any time they want to. If they want the updates to show up live on Qrindr, then that may take time after your PR has been approved.

There is no motivation for me to continue working on Qrindr, and any work I do it on it will be at my own will and will likely be security fixes if some do ever arise in the near future.
